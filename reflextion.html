<h1>This is the reflection report regarding the assignment.</h1>
<br>
<p1>The first thing we had to do before creating the website was figuring out a wireframe model that could display all the 6 pictures we wanted to show in a simple and pleasing manner. <br>
    We wanted all the pictures to show simultaneously on the website, that way the user didn’t have to scroll or browse through the website to look at all the pictures.
    <br> With that came the first challenge that we encountered when creating implementing the Wireframe into the website. It was difficult to arrange the pictures in such a way so that all 6 of them appeared side by side in one page.
    <br> If we had done that, we had to either reduce the picture size all the way down, or display a small version of the picture that when clicked would display the picture in its full size in another tab. Although this idea was not necessarily bad, there was the problem regarding the text description that would follow each picture. <br>
    It was unintuitive to have the pictures open in a new tab in full screen, but their description remaining in the original page.
    <br> Duo to this issue we had to significantly change the paper wireframe that we had originally planned on paper and go with something else. After a decent amount of research, we decided that we should utilize the grid layout elements to display our picture, we did that using columns. <br>
    Rather than having 6 columns beside each other horizontally we decided to make 3 columns but have each of them contain 2 rows. This allowed us to place 3 pictures in one row, then below that another 3 pictures. This decision allowed us to display our pictures in a reasonable size without having to make them clickable.
    <br> In addition to that this allowed each picture to have the short description directly below it while still allocating enough space to the picture below it. In summary this design decision made the website much more intuitive and resembling a gallery. </p1>
<br>
<br>
<p2>When it came to our phone design, the opposite of what I describe above happened. Since the phone screen size is relatively small usually websites on the phone are designed in a similar way. Phone screens have small widths; therefore, most phone website layouts don’t utilize sideways scrolling but use vertical scrolling instead. Based on this we knew from the beginning that having to scroll sideways on the phone to view the picture would not be convenient. So, we designed our wireframe on paper while keeping that in mind. When it came to designing the phone layout not much had to be done. Much of the work that went into making the phone website was regarding column and picture measurements. Had we copied our picture and column measurement from the desktop part to the phone part the phone layout would’ve been all over the place. Therefore, we had to resize practically all pictures and adjust in column width and height in order to make a functioning design on the mobile screen. Small adjustments to the header and footer sizes also had to be made that way the text did not clip through the screen. One major problem we encountered when making this website was the fact that our Wireframes contained textboxes under each picture. These textboxes were planned to be not regular p tags under pictures, but a dedicated box that would contain the text and possibly other things as well. We decided against this idea as it would essentially just increase that amount of work that had to be done, especially when it came to the mobile design without really adding any observable benefit to the viewer of the site. </p2>
<br>
<br>
<p3>Finally, regarding some basic design decisions, we had to decide on colors and fonts. We decided to use the same font throughout the entire website, except for the header. Regarding the color scheme we had initially thought gray would be fitting, as it is easy on the eyes, but after we viewed the final design, it looked rather dull and boring, so we swapped it for a white font with a blue background. To match the background color with the header background image color we had to use an rgb color picker. </p3>
